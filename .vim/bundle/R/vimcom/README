The development version of the R package "VimCom" is available at github.
To download and build it do the following in a terminal emulator:

git clone git://github.com/jalvesaq/VimCom.git
R CMD build VimCom
R CMD INSTALL vimcom_0.9-5.tar.gz

However, note that you only need the version of VimCom available in the
github repository if you are using the development version of Vim-R-plugin.
